            <h2 id="learning-summary">Concepts You’ve Learned (Git & GitHub)</h2>

            <p><b>Briefly explain the Git & GitHub concepts you’ve learned so far (like repository basics, status,
                    staging, commits, history, branching, merging, etc.).</b></p>

            <p>
                ✦ Imagine you’re explaining these ideas to a 10th-grade student, so use <b>simple words</b> and
                <b>easy-to-understand examples or analogies</b>.
                <br>✦ Also, think like a <b>DevOps/Cloud engineer</b> – sometimes applications fail, and while you may
                not fix
                the app code itself, you need to <b>look into code snippets, logs, or commit history</b> to understand
                what went wrong.
                <br>✦ For example: a wrong database connection string in code will show up in logs, and using Git
                history you can
                check <i>who changed it</i> and <i>when</i>.
            </p>

            <p><b>Your Task:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explain Git concepts in your own words (as if teaching someone new).</li>
                <li>Connect at least one Git concept with a real-world debugging scenario.
                    <small>(e.g., “If an application suddenly stops connecting to the database, I can use
                        <code>git log</code> to
                        see if someone recently changed the configuration file.”)</small>
                </li>
                <li>Write 8–10 lines in simple language, add screenshots if possible.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="Git is a tool that helps track changes in code. A repository (repo) is where your project’s files and history are stored. When you make changes, Git lets you check the status to see what’s been edited. You can stage files to prepare them for saving, and then commit them to record the changes permanently with a message explaining what you did.

Every commit adds to the project’s history, so you can go back and see who changed what and when. Branching allows you to work on new features without affecting the main project, and merging combines your work back into the main branch once it’s ready.

For example, if a switch or router is configured wrongly, I use the debug or search the log to check details of the error and  if someone recently changed the configuration file. This helps me find the cause of the issue quickly.

GitHub is an online platform that stores Git repositories, making it easy to collaborate with others and manage projects in the cloud.">[Write your learning summary here – including both Git basics and one debugging
